                    My name is Kenny Lindblom and i am 29 years old and im from and currently living in Vargberg
                    Sweden<br></br>
                    I am studying systemdeveloper at Campus Varberg<br></br>
                    I have always had a intressted in thechnology and would describe myself as ambitius and currius.<br></br>
                    I love working out at the gym and sometimes go climbing<br></br>
                    My background is in logistics. I spent some time working at Carlsberg Sverige AB in Falkenberg
                    <br> first with pre production as in supplying production with material and later i worked with the <br>
                    automated warehouse making sure that all machine and systems was working together and orders went out to<br>
                    customers as planned.<br></br>
                    I started to attend some IT related courses at the <i>Univerity of Borås</i> and that was where my intressted for system<br>
                    development really started to take of and i knew that this was something i wanted to devote my full attention to <br>
                    so in 2021 i started my journey to become a Fullstack developer.
